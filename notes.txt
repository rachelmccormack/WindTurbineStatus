*Plan and approach notes* 
- First thoughts were "Oh this is just a variation of the fizzbuzz test!"
- I tutor high school student in Python and recently I have been giving out fizzbuzz as homework to make sure they can understand loops and mathematical operations. 
    This made it feel like a trick quesiton a bit. 
- Or maybe cheating because I knew the solution without much hassle. 
- Did not have any problems with the php other than missing a semicolon once or twice -  that was good. Even getting php set up with IIS wasn't a big deal. 
- It was nice to code a wee thing on the weekend that was kind of familiar but kind of new.  
- Was more puzzled with how best to display all the information. A table? a big list? Eventually went with the bootstrap grid. Split the results into 4 columns of 25.  
- Added " Running Normally" for the non broken items - looked wrong to leave them blank. 
- Highlighted the errors. Kind of assumed struck by lightning was worse than coating damage so used the warning on that and info on the coating ones. 
- If we were extending this we would probably have a view with a list of other wind turbines (assuming we have more than one) 
    and perhaps some kind of triage/colour code highlights for the wind turbines with the most item failure.
- Different wind turbines may have a different number of items to be inspected - we couldn't "hardcode" the column sizes like I have. 
    We may need to paginate for larger lists, or reduce the number of columns for a smaller list.
- Clicking on the error could give more information on severity/ the data was used to make the judgement.  
- I have vague memory of using EC2 before. Took a few tries to get it working but it's up at http://54.194.157.117/windTurbine.php

Was really curious about "extra" number 2:
2. Pulling the inspection data down in an Ajax call and processing the results in the browser
I couldn't think what data we needed to send and retrieve? What was needing to be updated here? 
I even messaged my friends (who have the same kind of experience level, but use different technologies) after to see what they made of it.
We couldn't agree with a reason. Maybe some kind of extension to the page? 
Everyones curious now, would really appreciate if someone could let me know what the use for this would be.
